        "To calculate the variance of Y, the coefficient of determination of X and Y, and the standard error of estimate of X on Y and Y on X, we need additional information such as the correlation coefficient between X and Y. However, based on the equations provided, we can make some assumptions and proceed with the calculations.\n",
